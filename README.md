# Fullstack Assessment - Stock portfolio

## What this project is about
Creating a full stack webstie where we let users log in and they are able to buy assets (for this project, an asset can be bought or sold like a house) with fluctuating prices throughout the day.

- The goal for this project is to allow users to buy numbers of shares if they have enough cash. 
- Asset prices are incidated via red, green, or grey color. Red indicates "Current price is less than day's opening price". 
  Green indicates "Current price si greater than the days' opening price.
  Gray indicated "Current price is equal to day's open price."
